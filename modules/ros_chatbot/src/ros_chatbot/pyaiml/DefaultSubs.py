"""This file contains the default (English) substitutions for the
PyAIML kernel.  These substitutions may be overridden by using the
Kernel.loadSubs(filename) method.  The filename specified should refer
to a Windows-style INI file with the following format:

    # lines that start with '#' are comments

    # The 'gender' section contains the substitutions performed by the
    # <gender> AIML tag, which swaps masculine and feminine pronouns.
    [gender]
    he = she
    she = he
    # and so on...
    # Comments that follow contradict AIML 1.0 person and person2 definitions, which were swapped for AIML 2.0
    #
    # The person section contains the substitutions performed by the
    # <person> AIML tag, which swaps 1st and 2nd person pronouns.
    [person]
    I = you
    you = I
    # and so on...

    # The 'person2' section contains the substitutions performed by
    # the <person2> AIML tag, which swaps 1st and 3nd person pronouns.
    [person2]
    I = he
    he = I
    # and so on...

    # the 'normal' section contains subtitutions run on every input
    # string passed into Kernel.respond().  It's mainly used to
    # correct common misspellings, and to convert contractions
    # ("WHAT'S") into a format that will match an AIML pattern ("WHAT
    # IS").
