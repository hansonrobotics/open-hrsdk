"""This module implements the WordSub class, modelled after a recipe
in "Python Cookbook" (Recipe 3.14, "Replacing Multiple Patterns in a
Single Pass" by Xavier Defrang).

Usage:
Use this class like a dictionary to add before/after pairs:
    > subber = TextSub()
    > subber["before"] = "after"
    > subber["begin"] = "end"
Use the sub() method to perform the substitution:
    > print subber.sub("before we begin")
    after we end
All matching is intelligently case-insensitive:
    > print subber.sub("Before we BEGIN")
    After we END
The 'before' words must be complete words -- no prefixes.
The following example illustrates this point:
    > subber["he"] = "she"
    > print subber.sub("he says he'd like to help her")
    she says she'd like to help her
Note that "he" and "he'd" were replaced, but "help" and "her" were
not.
